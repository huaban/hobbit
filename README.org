* hobbit
  Yet another erlang client for [[https://github.com/aphyr/riemann][riemann]], which is a network event
  stream processing system.
  
** Why another
   Mainly for fun and learning.
   There were already [[https://github.com/tel/zeta][zeta]] and [[https://github.com/Aircloak/erlang_riemann][erlang_riemann]]:
   zeta is a little outdate, erlang_riemann is just a little redundancy.
   
** Usage
   #+begin_src erlang
     %% send event
     Event = [
              {service, "redis"}, 
              {state, "ok"}, 
              {metric, 100}, 
              {tags, ["group1", "ssd"]}],
     hobbit:send(Event).
     
     %% send state, similar to event
     State = [
              {service, "redis"},
              {state, "ok"}],
     hobbit:send_state(State).
     
     %% query
     hobbit:query('service ~= \"redis\"').
   #+end_src
   
** Installation
   Include the *hobbit* applicaiton in your *rebar.config* file. Then add riemann
   as a dependent application to your *project.app*.

   Riemann will default to sending the metrics to localhost on port 5555.
   You can set the remote riemann host in your config:
   #+begin_src erlang
     [
      ...
        {hobbit, [
                  {host, "riemann.host"},
                  {port, 5555}]}
     ]
   #+end_src

** Test
   cd into the root directory:
   #+begin_src shell
   make eunit
   #+end_src
   
** Local debug
   1. start riemann service:
      sudo service riemann start
   2. cd into the root dir of hobbit:
      make dev
   3. start the [[https://github.com/basho/lager][lager]][logging] and hobbit process:
      application:start(lager).
      application:start(hobbit).
